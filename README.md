# Reflections

Reflections is an obsidian vault i made and have been iterating on since last year. when i was first introduced to obsidian. since then it has changed drastically and has only improved. i decided to share it based on my own experience of not being able to find vaults that suited me. hopefully this helps some, whether as a starting vault or one that gave them ideas and inspirations for their own vault.

## Overview

This vault is built around a somewhat flexible and rigid structure that helps track your day-to-day activities, creative inspirations, interactions, and more. it’s designed to be both a personal journal and a tool for organizing various aspects of your life.

---

## Daily Notes

 Record your daily activities using the followings:
 
 - **Journaling** your day
 - Noting **noteworthy** consumed content whether its movies, games, yt vids, blogs or good old wikipedia knowledge devouring. 
 - Documenting **memorable** interactions with loved ones or un-loved ones. you're choice!
 - Logging **accomplished** tasks (Milestones) and pending tasks (Targets)
 - Tracking sleep, habits, mood, and even shower routines for a bit of extra self-care. (Hygiene and mental health is important folks!)

## Weekly Notes

- Collects all the relevant data from the past 7 daily notes and puts them in a single place to view and analyze. 
- A bit buggy when scrolling at the bottom in reading mode due to dataview (maybe. im not sure). anyways, idk how to fix it. sorry!

![Weekly Notes](https://github.com/masterelf425900/Reflections-an-obsidian-vault/blob/main/Images/Weekly%20Notes%20Template.avif)

---

## Monthly Notes

- Same as weekly except its for the entire month. 
- A bit redundant and one im still figuring out on how to layout properly. right now i count it as a bonus.

## Entertainment

This section is divided into three main note folders:

1. **Movies**: Uses the OMDB API key through the Quickadd plugin.

2. **TV Shows**: Also requires an OMDB API key via Quickadd.

3. **Games**: requires a RAWG API key via Quickadd.

![Entertainment & Finance](https://github.com/masterelf425900/Reflections-an-obsidian-vault/blob/main/Images/Media%20&%20Finance.avif)

**How to use the API keys:**
- Obtain your OMDB and RAWG API keys (they’re easy to get).
- Open the Quickadd plugin options.
- Click the gear icon for the respective category (Movies, TV Shows, or Games).
- In the subsequent menu, click the additional gear icon.
- at the top, click another gear icon for the respective category (Movies, TV Shows, or Games).
- Paste the appropriate API key (OMDB for Movies/TV Shows; RAWG for Games).
- Now you can just click on the quickadd tool on the left side toolbar right above daily notes and add in your media of category.
- Theres no 1-10 rating. i use a Weak,Fair,Strong and Mighty rating. similar to opencritics approach.

**Poster Setup:**
- Vertical/portrait posters from the official databases are generally of lower quality and dont match the overall look of the vault setup. looks wonky and too much empty space with vertical posters.
- Download a wide or horizontal poster by just Googling. (adding any streaming service names makes them easier to find)
- Place your poster in the root folder under `09-Extras/Referenced Images/` (I’ve organized some subfolders for organizing purposes).

## People

This folder contains notes about people in your life. it links back to the Interactions section in your Daily Notes, capturing memorable dialogues and interactions worth remembering. no need to document every word, just the moments that count!.

---

## Finances

this one is a bit of a...i dont know how to put it. basically its supposed to be a place to write down your financial transactions and keep track of money. where it went and from whom and did it grow on trees (in here it can). 

it uses the double entry system so making mistakes while accounting (we've all been there) should be minimal. this one is the most recent addition to the vault and leaves a lot to be desired still. i would love to be able to find a way to export the transactions to a pdf or something. that may never happen tho so feel free to discard.

---

## Extras

A catch-all section for:
- Meta bind keys
- Templates
- Images
- Other resources that don’t neatly fit into the main sections
